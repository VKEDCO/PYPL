"On Video Analysis of Omnidirectional Bee Traffic: Counting Bee Motions with Motion
 Detection and Image Classification." Applied Sciences, 2019, 9(18), 3743;
 https://doi.org/10.3390/app9183743; the article's pdf, ApplSci_2019_9_18_3743.pdf,
 is included in the archive.

2) The file beepi_convents.py in source/ contains the topology of each net we trained,
tested and validated for the research reported in the article; the pdf contains
the links to our image datasets.

3) The TFLearn files with the trained models are available at https://usu.app.box.com/s/v2kty7tujspf04phpbjpt2hnj595yify.
If you download them, put them into models/ to run the code.

4) yb.png, nb.png, yb2.png, nb2.png in img/ contain 4 sample images;
   yb.png and yb2.png contain bees; nb.png and nb2.png don't.

5) The following files contain examples of how to load and run each model on
the individual images:

  - beepi_convnetgs1_1s.py, beepi_convnetgs1_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnetgs2_1s.py, beepi_convnetgs2_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnetgs3_1s.py, beepi_convnetgs3_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnetgs4_1s.py, beepi_convnetgs4_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnetgs5_1s.py, beepi_convnetgs3_2s.py;
  - beepi_vgg16_1s.py, beepi_vgg16_2s.py;
  - beepi_resnet32_1s.py, beepi_resnet32_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet1_1s.py, beepi_convnet1_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet2_1s.py, beepi_convnet2_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet3_1s.py, beepi_convnet3_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet4_1s.py, beepi_convnet4_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet5_1s.py, beepi_convnet5_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet6_1s.py, beepi_convnet6_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet7_1s.py, beepi_convnet7_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet8_1s.py, beepi_convnet8_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet9_1s.py, beepi_convnet9_2s.py;
  - beepi_convnet10_1s.py, beepi_convnet10_2s.py.

6) The bee and no-bee probabilities in the comments in the files in 5) are not
true mathematical probabilities in that they don't add up to 1. They are
numbers (e.g., softmax crossentropy) assigned by a trained net to BEE
and NO-BEE categories. Thus, the output like

bee_probability    = 0.0001715152757242322
no_bee_probability = 0.007666190154850483

means that a specific net recognized neither BEE nor NO-BEE in a given image.
On the other hand, the output like

bee_probability    = 0.9240301251411438
no_bee_probability = 0.07596990466117859

means that a specific net categorized a given image as a BEE.

7) The models persisted in models/ have been trained, tested, and validated
in Python 3.6.7, tensorflow 1.13.1 on Ubuntu 18.04LTS.
